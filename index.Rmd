*idea - if any of the EWS alarms go off, have text at the top of the page that there is a bloom!

This is to test displaying new incoming data for the upcoming field season. 
 
1) print the time of the last update 
2) check if there are any missing data or outliers 
  - keep a running list 
3) shiny app to easily display data from the 3 lakes? (instead of scrolling through a static page with all the variables)
4) EWS and early fancy stats/math that PIs want
  

Time of last update:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
print(Sys.time())
```


```{r, echo=FALSE}
data(cars)
plot(cars$speed, cars$dist)
```
