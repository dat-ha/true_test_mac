*idea - if any of the EWS alarms go off, have text at the top of the page that there is a blooom!

This is to test displaying new incoming data for the upcoming field season. 
We want to 
1) print the time of the last update 
2) check if there are any missing data or outliers 
3) 

Time of last update:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
print(Sys.time())
```



```{r, echo=FALSE}
data(cars)
plot(cars$speed, cars$dist)
```
